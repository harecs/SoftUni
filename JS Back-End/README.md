### The course is intensive and aims to familiarize students with developing server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. During the course, the students will understand how to create a server with Node.js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools. One of the most popular non-relational databases, MongoDB, will be covered, along with the Mongoose library for taking data from it.
